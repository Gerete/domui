									PACKAGE - single thread runs single package with all containg classes
									TEST - single thread runs single TEST element within specified testNg test suite(s). Works only if [-suiteFiles] is used.
								if [-suiteFiles] is in use default is TEST, otherwise default is CLASS

	-include.package		, list of packages to include into running tests. This option is ignored if paired with [-parallel TEST] 								
	-root					, location where tool starts, all paths are relative from here
								(if not specified uses default location where command is executed) 
	-threads				, number of parallel threads executing tests
								(default is 5)
	-remove.generated		, true | false
								 if specified, removes generated on-the-fly per thread suites
								(default is true)
	-single.report			, true | false
								 if specified, assembles single test report at the end
								(default is true)
	-suiteFiles				, one or more testNG suite xml files
								(relative to [root] location, if non is specified test are discovered within [-project] locations)
	-testng.reporter.root	, root location where generated test suites and testNG reports and screenshots are created
								(if not specified uses same location as root)
	-testng.reporter		, specific reporter attached as testNG runner listener

	-testng.browser			, firefox chrome ie ie7 ie8 ie9 ie10 (one or more)
